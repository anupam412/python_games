The code written here is my implementation of the pong game which is the final project in the coursera [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1/home/welcome)
Note: This code will work outside code skulptor also. To do so you will first have to install the module SimpleGUICS2Pygame [(link)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16387770/how-to-integrate-simplegui-with-python-2-7-and-3-0-shell) which is a simple implementation of 
the simplegui module that works only on codeskulptor.

Please refer to the above link on how to do so.
